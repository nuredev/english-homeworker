Writing letters, memos or reports are the ways most people use computers. They manipulate
words and a text on a screen – primarily to print at some later time and store for safe keeping.
Computers alleviate much of the tedium associated with typing, proofing and manipulating words.
Because computers can store and recall information so readily, documents need not be retyped from
scratch just to make corrections or changes. The real strength of word processing lies in this ability
to store, retrieve and change information. Typing is still necessary (at least, for now) to put the
information into the computer initially, but once in, the need to retype only applies to new
information.

Word processing is more than just typing, however. Features such as Search and Replace
allow users to find a particular phrase or word no matter where it is in a body of text. This becomes
more useful as the amount of text grows.

Word processors usually include different ways to view the text. Some include a view that
displays the text with editor’s marks that show hidden characters or commands (spaces, returns,
paragraph endings, applied styles, etc.). Many word processors include the ability to show exactly
how the text will appear on paper when printed. This is called WYSIWYG (What You See Is What
You Get, pronounced “wizzy-wig”). WYSIWYG shows bold, italic, underline and other style
characteristics on the screen so that the user can clearly see what he or she is typing. Another
feature is the correct display of different typefaces and format characteristics (margins, indents,
super- and sub-scripted characters, etc.). This allows the user to plan the document more accurately
and reduces the frustration of printing something that doesn’t look right. Many word processors
now have so many features that they approach the capabilities of layout applications for desktop
publishing. They can import graphics, format multiple columns of text, run text around graphics,
etc.

Two important features offered by word processors are automatic hyphenation and mail
merging. Automatic hyphenation is the splitting of a word between two lines so that the text will fit
better on the page.

The word processor constantly monitors words typed and when it reaches the end of a line,
if a word is too long to fit, it checks that word in a hyphenation dictionary. This dictionary contains
a list of words with the preferred places to split it. If one of these cases fits part of the word at the
end of the line, the word processor splits the word, adds a hyphen at the end and places the rest on
the next line. This happens extremely fast and gives text a more polished and professional look.

Mail merge applications are largely responsible for the explosion of ‘personalized’ mail.
Form letters with designated spaces for names and addresses are stored as documents with links to
lists of names and addresses of potential buyers or clients. By designating what information goes
into which blank space, a computer can process a huge amount of correspondence substituting the
‘personal’ information into a form letter. The final document appears to be typed specifically to the
person addressed.

Many word processors can also generate tables of numbers or figures, sophisticated indices
and comprehensive tables of contents.
